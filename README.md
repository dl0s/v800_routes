v800_routes
===========

This program will take a GPX or KML file (possibly other formats later) and translate it into
a V800 readable proute.bpb file that can then be transferred to the V800 for route usage. Is this
possible? I think it is technically possible; this is the first step in attempting this. The next
step is updating v800_downloader to allow an upload of a file; researching how to do this _seems_
pretty straightforward but I've yet to actually attempt it. With some luck hopefully we'll be able
to create our own routes and upload them to the V800 without the support of Polar!
